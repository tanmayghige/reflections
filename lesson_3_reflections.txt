When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    I would want to use remote repository for cases like when I am travelling or I don't
    have access to my computer but I want to work on my project. I think it will be useful
    to have a remote repository in such cases.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Sometimes there might be a bug which we don't want in our local repository or we didn't
    like the changes we made in remote and don't want them to be present in local repository,
    pulling changes manually is the best thing to do.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of
another?

    Forks are the copies of repositories of some other person in our profile. clones are copies
    of our own repository on GitHub or locally. Branches are created for checking out experimental
    features without making changes in our master file.
    So, I will Fork someone's repository to make some changes I like, will clone my repository
    locally when I cannot edit the files on GitHub because of size of code, and create a Branch
    when I want to try some new features or experimental changes without affecting my original
    file.
